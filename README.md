# ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Overview**

Welcome to the Pet Paradise Webstore designed and developed by Sione Yerkovich.

The vision of this site was to design a webstore where customers can easily navigate through the UI via device of choice, without sacrificing functionality for design principles. My intent was to create an inviting, user friendly experience while maintaining
the key-aspects of a traditional e-commerce site and its functions. Prior to commencing this project, I had some business-rules laid out to simulate a real-world scenario for development:

1. Design must adhere to core design principles (spacing, sizing, white-space, eye-pathways)
2. Ensure pages are responsive to all viewports
3. Include a navigation bar for user-friendly traversal
4. Include a functioning shop where customers can add to their cart and adjust accordingly
5. Design an eye-catching but functional blog page

# üöÄ **Tech Stack**

I built this site all the way from a boilerplate to an (almost, see Future Scope below) fully functional e-commerce store as a way to display, test and improve my skillset with web development tools, languages and frameworks.

I utilised ***HTML*** to build the overall skeleton of every component/page; with ***CSS*** to further customise and style individual elements contained therein. The ***Bootstrap*** framework provided me with the tools to make it responsive to all viewports (Mobile or larger).

***Javascript*** was implemented as a method of adding functionality to the various features the site offers including logic such as product data importing & exporting and calculative functions.

# üåü **Plans for Future Scope**

- Toast to notify the user it has been added to the cart (COMPLETED)
- Change product data to remove duplicates (COMPLETED)
- Add shipping options that reflect in the checkout total
- Add Discount modal with code to Index.html to create purpose for "Discount" feature in Cart.html
- Create subtotal function (COMPLETED)
- Add pagination to Shop.html
